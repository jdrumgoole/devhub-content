# devhub-content

This the master repository for the DevHub repo. Content is written using reStructured Text but uses a number of proprietary extensions and the site as a whole is built using the Snooty tool chain. As a result the input files are expected to have a **.txt** extension. Files with a different extension will not be processed.
